# 🧠 DELLM - Dynamic Environment Large Learning Model

DELLM is an advanced AI system that implements a human-inspired sleep-wake cycle for continuous learning and improvement. Built on a brain-inspired neural architecture, it features a dual-mode system that alternates between active interaction and deep consolidation phases, similar to how humans process information and learn from experiences.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧬 Brain-Inspired Architecture
- Hierarchical neural assemblies that mimic cortical structures
- Biologically plausible learning mechanisms
- Dynamic growth and pruning for continuous adaptation
- ReLU-based neurons with adaptive thresholds

### 🔄 Dual-Mode Learning System
- **Awake Mode**: Active interaction, real-time processing, and immediate learning
- **Rest Mode**: Deep consolidation, pattern extraction, and structural optimization

### 🌐 Multimodal Processing
- Integrated processing of text, audio, and visual inputs
- Cross-modal understanding and association
- Unified representation across modalities
- Real-time speech recognition and transcription
- Raw audio feature extraction and processing

### 📈 Continuous Improvement Mechanics
- Direct learning from user feedback ("do it this way" functionality)
- Batch learning during rest periods for deeper pattern recognition
- Meta-learning to optimize its own learning processes
- "Dream" simulations to test hypothetical scenarios

### 🏗️ Dynamic Structural Evolution
- Neural assemblies that grow and reorganize based on experience
- Automatic specialization for recurring patterns
- Efficiency optimization through selective pruning
- Connection strength adaptation based on usage patterns

### Audio Processing
- Real-time speech recognition using Realtime STT
- Raw audio feature extraction using custom neural network
- Automatic transcription and text processing
- Support for both CPU and GPU processing

## 🔧 How It Works

### Awake Mode (Active Learning)
- Processes multimodal inputs in real-time
- Updates neural connections based on immediate feedback
- Maintains context awareness throughout interactions
- Automatically switches to rest mode after period of inactivity (configurable)
- Optimized for responsiveness and immediate adaptation

### Rest Mode (Consolidation)
- Performs deeper processing on accumulated experiences
- Runs batch learning algorithms on stored interactions
- Optimizes neural structures through growth and pruning
- Conducts "dream" simulations to test hypothetical scenarios
- Refines cross-modal associations and representations
- Reorganizes knowledge for more efficient access
- Automatically saves improved model state using safetensors

### "Do It This Way" Learning
DELLM uniquely allows direct feedback incorporation:
- Tell DELLM how you want it to perform specific tasks
- Corrections are given high priority in the learning process
- System will immediately adjust its behavior based on feedback
- Improvements persist across sessions through consolidation
